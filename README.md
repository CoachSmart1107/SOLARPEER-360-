Solar Tracking Module (Summary for Flowchart)
The solar tracking system uses an Arduino Uno and two LDR sensors to detect sunlight intensity and orient the panel for optimal exposure using an MG996 servo motor. When LDR1 ≠ LDR2, the panel rotates toward the sensor with higher light. If both values are equal, it stays centered. This dynamic adjustment improves energy capture by up to 30%.

A 25W, 12V Photovoltaic USB Output Solar Panel is used for energy generation,  An Arduino Uno (ATmega2560) micro-controller controls the solar tracking mechanism, An MG996 metallic servo motor adjusts the solar panel's position based on sunlight intensity, Two Light Dependent Resistors LDR sensors with a resistance value of 2,000Ω are used to detect sunlight intensity. Each LDR is paired with a 10,000Ω resistor to form a voltage divider circuit. A 4S2P LiFePO4 battery pack (12.8V, 18Ah) stores the energy generated by the solar panel. This pack consists of 8 batteries in total, An ACS712 10A current sensor and a DC voltage sensor are enclosed in a plastic pattress box to monitor the sys tem's output, A 13inch OLED display provides real-time monitoring of the solar panel's output, including voltage, current, and battery state-of-charge (SOC), A 12V light bulb is on-boarded to serve as a direct load from the solar panel and A metallic frame/stand holds the solar panel and other components securely. .

P2P Energy Sharing and Intrusion Detection  Hardware Components: An ESP32 micro-controller manages the P2P energy sharing platform, A 1channel 12V relay module controls the flow of electricity to each tenant based on their purchased units, An ACS712 10A current sensor, a DC voltage sensor, and a power sensor monitor each tenant's energy usage, An HCSR04 ultrasonic range sensor detects unauthorized access to the hardware and alerts the system owner.
The hardware architecture comprises several interconnected blocks: the solar panel block, charge controller block, battery block, load block, and P2P sharing block. The system also includes an OLED screen display for real-time data visualization and multiple relay switches to control energy flow
